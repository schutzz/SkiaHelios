## 👁️ Overview
**SH_PlutosGate** is the "Gatekeeper" of the [SkiaHelios](https://github.com/schutzz/SkiaHelios) forensics suite.
It focuses on **Data Exfiltration Verification**—proving not just *what* happened on the disk, but *where* the data went.

By correlating USB artifacts (LNK/Registry) and Network Usage (SRUM) with the "Ghost Files" detected by **SH_PandorasLink**, PlutosGate provides the final piece of the puzzle: **"The File was deleted here, but it was copied to THIS USB drive first."**

## ✨ Key Features (v1.0)
* **Ghost Correlation:** Automatically links deleted files (from Pandora) with LNK history on Removable drives.
* **Verdict Logic:**
    * `CONFIRMED_EXFILTRATION`: The file is deleted from the OS (Ghost) AND has access logs on a USB drive. (Guilty!)
    * `POTENTIAL_EXFILTRATION`: File accessed on USB, but still exists on the OS (or not in Pandora list).
* **SRUM Profiling:** Parses `SRUDB.dat` to identify high-bandwidth applications (e.g., Rclone, Mega-cmd, Browsers) responsible for cloud exfiltration.
* **Sniper Mode:** Recursively searches KAPE output directories for relevant LNK, Registry, and SRUM CSVs.

## 🚀 Usage

### Requirements
* **Input:** KAPE/EZTools Output Folder (containing LNK, System Registry, SRUM).
* **Optional:** `pandora_ghost_list.csv` (generated by **SH_PandorasLink**).

### Command
```bash
# Full Analysis (Correlation with Ghost List)
python SH_PlutosGate.py ^
  --dir "C:\Case\KAPE_Output" ^
  --pandora "pandora_ghost_list.csv"

# Traffic & USB Analysis only (No Pandora)
python SH_PlutosGate.py --dir "C:\Case\KAPE_Output"
```

## 📊 Output Schema (`plutos_report.csv`)

| Column | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Target_FileName** | The specific file in question. |
| **Plutos_Verdict** | **`CONFIRMED_EXFILTRATION`** or `POTENTIAL`. |
| **Risk_Tag** | Inherited from Pandora (e.g., `WIPING_TRACE`). |
| **SourceModified** | Timestamp of the last interaction on the external device. |
| **Total_Sent_MB** | (Network Report) Data volume sent by the process. |
