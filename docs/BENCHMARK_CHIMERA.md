# 🦁 Operation Chimera: Validation Report (Updated 2025-12-24)

> **"Testing the limits against Atomic Red Team & Real-world Scenarios"**

This document summarizes the validation results of **SkiaHelios v2.6** against a simulated APT scenario generated by **Atomic Red Team**, updated with the latest artifact correlation results.

## 🧪 Test Environment
* **Target OS:** Windows 10 Enterprise
* **Attack Framework:** [Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team)
* **Forensic Image Acquisition:** KAPE (Triage Mode)
* **Analysis Tool:** SkiaHelios (Full Auto Scan)

## ⚔️ Attack Scenarios & Detection Results

In the latest analysis session (2025-12-24), SkiaHelios successfully identified and correlated all major attack vectors.

| Attack Vector | Simulation Details | Module | Detection Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Timestomping** | Backdating of multiple system DLLs (PJLMON.DLL, etc.) and attack scripts. | **Chronos** | **🔴 DETECTED**<br>(14 `TIMESTOMP_BACKDATE` anomalies identified) |
| **Obfuscated Script** | Suspicious command executions originating from `services.exe` and `sc.exe`. | **Sphinx** | **🔴 DETECTED**<br>(4 suspicious hints decoded and scored) |
| **Data Exfiltration** | Data transit via `onedrive.exe` and `msedge.exe`. | **Plutos** | **🔴 DETECTED**<br>(OneDrive transit flagged as `CONFIRMED_EXFILTRATION`) |
| **Persistence** | Malicious entries in HKCU Run keys and Task Scheduler. | **AION** | **🔴 DETECTED**<br>(48 persistence mechanisms identified and scored) |

## 📊 Module Performance Insights (2025-12-24 Results)

### 1. AION (Persistence)
* **Performance:** Excellent.
* **Observation:** Successfully identified 48 persistence points. Specifically flagged `OneDrive` in the HKCU Run key (marked as `Suspicious_Path`) and multiple OneDrive-related tasks in the Task Scheduler (`onedrivestandaloneupdater.exe`, etc.).

### 2. Chronos (Time Verification)
* **Performance:** High-precision temporal anomaly detection.
* **Detection Count:** 14 anomalies.
* **Analysis:** Identified a cluster of backdated system DLLs (MXDWDRV.DLL, PSCRIPT5.DLL, UNIDRV.DLL, etc.) occurring around 2025-09-15. Also successfully captured the timestomping of the attack script `Run_Chimera_ART.ps1` at 2025-12-24 06:34.

### 3. Sphinx (Deciphering)
* **Performance:** Accurate extraction of process context.
* **Observation:** Decoded payloads originating from `sc.exe`, `services.exe`, and `powershell.exe`. Captured specific AppIDs and parent-child process relationships used for script execution.

### 4. Plutos (Exfiltration)
* **Performance:** Enhanced correlation between local access and external transit.
* **Observation:** Confirmed exfiltration via `onedrive.exe` at 2025-12-21 11:30. Additionally tracked `msedge.exe` activity and access to the script `set-persistenceaudit.ps1` as high-risk potential exfiltration events.

## 🏆 Conclusion

**SkiaHelios maintained a 100% detection rate against the tested scenarios.**

The suite demonstrated its capability to weave disparate evidence—from low-level MFT anomalies (Chronos) to exfiltration routes (Plutos)—into a cohesive "Grimoire" (Storyline). The system is fully prepared for the SANS FOR500 CTF Challenge Coin attempt.
