# 🦁 Operation Chimera: Validation Report

> **"Testing the limits against Atomic Red Team"**

This document summarizes the validation results of **SkiaHelios v2.5** against a simulated APT scenario generated by **Atomic Red Team**.

## 🧪 Test Environment
* **Target OS:** Windows 10 Enterprise (Virtual Machine)
* **Attack Framework:** [Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team)
* **Forensic Image Acquisition:** KAPE (Triage Mode)
* **Analysis Tool:** SkiaHelios (Full Auto Scan)

## ⚔️ Attack Scenarios & Detection Results

We executed specific atomic tests to simulate **Persistence, Defense Evasion, and Exfiltration**. SkiaHelios successfully detected artifacts across all vectors.

| Attack Vector | Technique ID | Simulation Details | Module | Detection Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **WMI Persistence** | **T1546.003** | Malicious WMI Event Subscription (CommandConsumer) | **AION** | **🔴 DETECTED**<br>(Score: 37 / Tags: Atomic_Red_Team) |
| **Timestomping** | **T1070.006** | Modification of file timestamps to mimic system files | **Chronos** | **🔴 DETECTED**<br>(Mismatch found in `$MFT` attributes) |
| **Obfuscated Script** | **T1027** | Base64/Compressed PowerShell payload execution | **Sphinx** | **🔴 DETECTED**<br>(Decoded & Flagged as "Suspicious") |
| **Data Exfiltration** | **T1048** | Exfiltration via Cloud Storage (OneDrive) & USB | **Plutos** | **🔴 DETECTED**<br>(Correlated LNK + File Access) |
| **File Deletion** | **T1070.004** | Deletion of artifacts/logs to hide tracks | **Pandora** | **🔴 DETECTED**<br>(Recovered from USN Journal / Ghosts) |

## 📊 Module Performance Insights

### 1. AION (Persistence)
* **Performance:** Excellent.
* **Observation:** Successfully parsed `Autoruns.csv` despite non-standard headers and encoding issues. Identified the malicious WMI consumer immediately.

### 2. Chronos (Time Verification)
* **Performance:** **Hyper-Sensitive (High Noise Floor)**
* **Detection Count:** 40,445 anomalies flagged.
* **Analysis:** * **Success:** Successfully detected the simulated timestomping attack (T1070.006) on the target payload.
    * **Challenge:** The module currently flags *any* nanosecond discrepancy between `$STANDARD_INFORMATION` and `$FILE_NAME`. In a Windows environment, legitimate background processes (TrustedInstaller, Windows Update, Log rotation) frequently create these discrepancies, resulting in a high False Positive rate.
* **Verdict:** While effective at detecting the attack, the current logic requires significant manual filtering.
* **Roadmap (v3.0):** Implementation of "Smart Filtering" to prioritize **Executables (.exe, .dll, .sys)** and **Scripts (.ps1, .bat)**, ignoring low-risk file types (logs, caches) to improve Signal-to-Noise ratio.

### 3. Sphinx (Deciphering)
* **Performance:** Accurate.
* **Observation:** Successfully extracted and decoded the Base64 payload from PowerShell Event Logs (Event ID 4104). The entropy threshold adjustment (v1.2) was critical for catching shorter obfuscated strings.

### 4. Plutos (Exfiltration)
* **Performance:** Precise.
* **Observation:** Correctly identified `OneDrive.exe` activity and the target script `set-persistenceaudit.ps1` as high-risk exfiltration candidates based on directory context.

## 🏆 Conclusion

**SkiaHelios achieved a 100% detection rate against the tested Atomic Red Team scenarios.**

While some modules (specifically **Chronos**) require fine-tuning to reduce noise in a production environment, the suite demonstrated the capability to identify "Hidden" artifacts that traditional timeline analysis might miss.
